In this article, we will compare the pros and cons of both resolutions, and help you decide which one suits your needs and budget better.
 
## What is the difference between 1080p and 4k?
 
1080p and 4k are two common terms used to describe the resolution of a display. Resolution refers to the number of pixels (or dots) that make up the image on the screen. The more pixels, the sharper and clearer the image.
 
1080p stands for 1920 x 1080 pixels, which means there are 1920 pixels horizontally and 1080 pixels vertically. This is also known as Full HD or FHD.
 
4k stands for 3840 x 2160 pixels, which means there are 3840 pixels horizontally and 2160 pixels vertically. This is also known as Ultra HD or UHD.
 
As you can see, 4k has four times more pixels than 1080p, which means it can display more details and textures on the screen.
 
## What are the benefits of 1080p?
 
Some of the benefits of choosing a 1080p display for your Visual Pinball playfield are:
 
- **Lower cost:** 1080p displays are generally cheaper than 4k displays, which means you can save some money or spend it on other components of your virtual pinball cabinet.
- **Better compatibility:** Most Visual Pinball tables are designed for 1080p resolution, which means they will look great and run smoothly on your display. You won't have to worry about scaling or adjusting the settings to fit your screen.
- **Lower hardware requirements:** To run Visual Pinball at 4k resolution, you will need a powerful graphics card that can handle the high pixel count. This can be expensive and consume more energy. With a 1080p display, you can use a more modest graphics card that will still deliver good performance and quality.

## What are the benefits of 4k?
 
Some of the benefits of choosing a 4k display for your Visual Pinball playfield are:

- **Better realism:** With 4k resolution, you can enjoy stunning graphics that will make you feel like you are playing on a real pinball machine. You will be able to see every detail, reflection, and shadow on the table, as well as the animations and effects on the backglass.
- **Better immersion:** With 4k resolution, you can have a larger screen size without compromising on image quality. This will give you a more immersive experience, as you will feel closer to the action and have a wider field of view.
- **Better future-proofing:** As technology advances, more Visual Pinball tables will be created or updated for 4k resolution. By choosing a 4k display, you will be ready to enjoy these tables when they become available, without having to upgrade your display later.

## Which one should you choose?
 
The answer to this question depends on your personal preference, budget, and hardware. There is no definitive answer, as both resolutions have their advantages and disadvantages.
 
If you are looking for a more affordable and compatible option, then a 1080p display might be a good choice for you. You will still get a great visual pinball experience, with decent graphics and performance.
 
If you are looking for a more realistic and immersive option, then a 4k display might be a good choice for you. You will get an amazing visual pinball experience, with stunning graphics and quality. However, you will also need to invest in a more powerful graphics card and make sure your tables support 4k resolution.
 
In conclusion, both resolutions can offer you a fun and enjoyable visual pinball experience. The best way to decide is to try them out yourself
