## What is *The Sophtware Slump*?
 
*The Sophtware Slump* is the second studio album by Grandaddy, released in May 2000 by record label V2. It is seen by some as a concept album about problems concerning modern technology in society[^3^] [^4^]. The album features songs about lonely robots, broken appliances, environmental degradation and alienation. The album received critical acclaim for its blend of lo-fi indie rock, psychedelic pop and electronic elements, as well as its lyrical depth and creativity. Some of the standout tracks include "He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot", "The Crystal Lake", "Jed's Other Poem (Beautiful Ground)" and "So You'll Aim Toward the Sky".
